# Smart Poultry Farm

## Project Overview

The Smart Poultry Farm project aims to revolutionize poultry farming by integrating advanced technology into the management and control of critical environmental conditions. The project comprises a Flutter mobile application that interfaces seamlessly with an Arduino-based control system.

### Project Goals
- **Provide real-time monitoring** and control of essential parameters such as temperature and humidity.
- **Automate vital tasks** including lighting and ventilation to maintain an optimal environment for poultry growth.
- **Enhance productivity** while promoting sustainable farming practices through the use of modern technology.

## System Components
- **Flutter Mobile Application**: An intuitive interface that allows users to monitor and manage the environmental conditions in the poultry farm, including:
  - **Sensors**:
    - **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor ambient temperature.
    - **Humidity Sensors**: Measure the humidity levels.
    - **Level Sensors**: Detect water levels in containers.
  - **Actuators**:
    - **Servo Motors**: Control the opening and closing of doors.
    - **Relays**: Manage the power to lights, fans, and other devices.
    - **Pumps**: Automate the watering of the chickens.

- **Arduino Control System**: Handles the automation of various tasks and collects data from sensors to ensure optimal conditions for incubation.

## How It Works
1. **Real-time Data Monitoring**: The Flutter app retrieves data from the Arduino system, allowing farmers to access crucial information about their farm's conditions.
2. **Automation**: Users can control lighting, ventilation, and other essential functions directly from the app, ensuring a stable environment for the chicks.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed for ease of use, providing farmers with quick access to vital information and control features.
